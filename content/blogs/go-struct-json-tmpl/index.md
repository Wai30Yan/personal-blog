This is a fun article for those who are interested in learning Go. This tutorial will show how to parse JavaScript Object Notation(JSON) with Go `struct` type, Text or HTML Templates with Go standard library.
{{</ lead >}}

### Introduction
Go has four types of data structure, arrays, slices, maps and struct. In this tutorial, we will use `struct`. To get a json object, we'll use my favorite api, [JokeAPI](https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/). I use this whenever I am learn new technologies such as `React`, `Flutter`, or backend development. 

Then, we will extract the json object from the http response and decode it to the `struct`. Finally, we'll use `template` libraries to save these jokes as both text and HTML files.

### JSON returned by the API

### Declaring struct base on JSON

### Write a function that fetch jokes

### Declare template variables
#### Text template
#### HTML template

### Parsing and Executing the templates
