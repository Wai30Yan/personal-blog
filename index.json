In this tutorial, we will go through a basic TCP websockets, both Client and Server. Currently, it\u0026rsquo;s only code. Explaination will be added soon.\u003e Currently, it\u0026rsquo;s only code. Explaination will be added soon. # TCP server\u003e TCP server # First, let\u0026rsquo;s start with building a TCP websocket server. Create a file name server.go. Then, add the following code.\npackage main import ( \u0026#34;os\u0026#34; ) func main() { arguments := os.Args if len(arguments) == 1 { fmt.Println(\u0026#34;Please provide a port number\\n\u0026#34;) } PORT := \u0026#34;:\u0026#34; + arguments[1] listener, err := net.Listen(\u0026#34;tcp\u0026#34;, PORT) if err != nil { fmt.Println(err) return } defer listener.Close() } I\u0026rsquo;m using command-line arguement for PORT number. But you can declare and assign a value in the code if you want. When you run the go file, you use the command go run main.go. main.go is the first arguement with index 0. Just include the port number at the end like this: go run main.go 1234.\nThis code is listener, err := net.Listen(\u0026quot;tcp\u0026quot;, PORT) is responsible for declaring a listener. The listener waits for incoming connections from clients. It is part of net package from standard library. The Listen func accept two parameters, protocol and port number.\nIn the example, I used \u0026ldquo;tcp\u0026rdquo;. There are other options like \u0026ldquo;udp\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;unix\u0026rdquo;.\nAccepting incoming TCP connections\u003e Accepting incoming TCP connections # To establish the communication, the listener needs to accept the incoming connection.

That is why gathering information about the target system is the very first step in pentesting. The most popular tool to do it is NMAP. This article will teach you how to use it in Kali LInux. What is NMAP?\u003e What is NMAP? # nmap, short for \u0026ldquo;Network Mapper\u0026rdquo; is a go to tool for reconessance. It scans the ports that are used in target system and checks the services running on those ports. You can use it to scan the machines in the same network or even web application which are hosted far from you. The only thing you need to know is the IP address of the targets. Targets with poorly implemented security will reveal\nPorts and Services\u003e Ports and Services # Every servers or computers have total of 65535 ports. The first 1024 ports are reserved for system. If you are familiar with web application development, notice the server runs on port :8080 and client on :3000, not between 1-1024.\nMost used ports numbers and services:\nservice port no HTTP 80 HTTPS 443 NETBIOS 139 SMB 445 FTP 20, 21 Using NMAP\u003e Using NMAP # Using nmap is very straight forward. The following command will scan the IP address provided. In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll use \u0026lsquo; www.owasp.org\u0026rsquo; for the example. Before, I used whatsmyid to find out the IP address.\n$ nmap 104.22.27.77 The result showed information such as PORT number, STATE of the port and what services were running. It also mentioned 996 tcp ports were filtered.\nHow about I only wanna to scan specific port\u003e How about I only wanna to scan specific port # In addition to IP address, you can add flags for more specific scanning. If you only want to scan port 20, you can do it as:\n// -p must be followed by the number $ nmap -p 80 104.22.27.77 To scan ports range from 80-100:\n$ nmap -p 80-100 104.22.27.77 If the default output does not include enough information, you can add -v for verbosity. Verbosity has 2 levels. Single v for level one and, double for level two. In the example photo, I used -vv flag for level two verbosity. You can see it has more information such as REASON compare to the first output.\nThere are many other -flags for more features. There are very simple and easy to learn. You can read the instruction by nmap -h or man nmap.\n","date":"11 February 2023","permalink":"/personal-blog/blogs/nmap/","section":"Personal Blogs","summary":"When it comes to hacking, knowledge is power.

It is used for communication between applications e.g. frontend and backend. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) are used for communication.\nThe frontend/client send HTTP requests to the backend/server. The backend send responses. Both request and response use JSON object as message. JSON objects are very easy to read as they are formatted in key-value pairs.\nWhat we\u0026rsquo;ll do?\u003e What we\u0026rsquo;ll do? # In this article, we\u0026rsquo;ll build a RESTful server without using third party libraries which is the beauty of Go as the standard library can do a lot of things. Some of the popular Go libraries are Gin Web Framework, Fiber and Gorilla\nYou can find the Github repo here.\nWhat does a server do?\u003e What does a server do? # The server will handle incoming HTTP requests and perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations. The server will have endpoint to operate HTTP requests. Finally, we will create a Person struct for data.\nIn this tutorial, we will define the endpoints as:\n/get to retrieve all person /person/{id} to retrieve a specific person based on id /add to create a new Person /update/{id} to update an existing Person in the list /delete/{id} to delete an existing Person in the list Declaring Person object for data\u003e Declaring Person object for data # type Person struct { ID int `json:\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;` Name string `json:\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;` Age int `json:\u0026#34;age\u0026#34;` } var People []Person In the code shown above, we declare Person object and People as slice of Person (array of people). You can consider slice as array in Go. The syntax `json:\u0026quot;id\u0026quot;` is to serialize the incoming JSON object. It is used for converting JSON objects to Go struct and vice versa. It is important to use the exact format and no spacing unless it is in double quote.\nImplementing the HTTP web server\u003e Implementing the HTTP web server # The server will be implemented in the main function. For the purpose of dealing with multiple routes (different endpoints), a multipluxer is created using the standard library mux := http.NewServeMux() and used it in the server.\nvar PORT = \u0026#34;:8080\u0026#34; func main() { mux := http.NewServeMux() s := \u0026amp;http.Server{ Addr: PORT, Handler: mux, IdleTimeout: 10 * time.Second, ReadTimeout: time.Second, WriteTimeout: time.Second, } } Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to change the PORT number if you have services running on :8080.\nStarting the server\u003e Starting the server # The code below will start the server on localhost:8080. However, you will see nothing at the moment as there is not any handler function that sends a response.\nfmt.Println(\u0026#34;Servering running at\u0026#34;, PORT) _ := s.ListenAndServe() You can start the server with the command go run {filename}.go.\nRetrieving all person (Read operation)\u003e Retrieving all person (Read operation) # Retrieving all person is the simplest job as it does not have params or query in the URL. Just a simple HTTP GET request will do the job.\nfunc getPeople(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { fmt.Println(\u0026#34;Endpoint Hit: getAllPerson\u0026#34;) json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(People) } Let\u0026rsquo;s breakdown the code json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(People).\njson is the standard library package. NewEncoder() and Encode() are functions that come with it. Encoder() send back a response to where the request came from. See w, ResponseWriter as the arguement. Encode() serialized the People slice to include it in HTTP response. See People we declared early as the arguement. Retrieve a specific person (Read operation)\u003e Retrieve a specific person (Read operation) # This operation is similar to the pervious one except the URL needs to have ID so that the server knows which Person to send back.\nfunc getPerson(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { fmt.Println(\u0026#34;Endpoint Hit: getPerson\u0026#34;) vars := strings.Split(r.URL.Path, \u0026#34;/\u0026#34;) param := vars[len(vars)-1] id, _ := strconv.Atoi(param) for _, person := range People { if person.ID == id { json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(person) } } } The URL http://localhost:8080/person/1 will return Person with ID: 1. First, the function will extract 1 from the URL and convert it to integar. Then, use that value to find the Person with the same ID and send back a response with it.\nUpdating a person (Update Operation)\u003e Updating a person (Update Operation) # Update function works same way as getPerson(), it extracts the ID from the URL. And, create a updatedPerson using that ID. Then, add the updated value from HTTP request body to the updatedPerson object.\nfunc updatePerson(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { fmt.Println(\u0026#34;Endpoint Hit: updatePerson\u0026#34;) vars := strings.Split(r.URL.Path, \u0026#34;/\u0026#34;) param := vars[len(vars)-1] id, _ := strconv.Atoi(param) updatedPerson := Person{ ID: id, } json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(\u0026amp;updatedPerson) for i, person := range People { if person.ID == id { People[i] = updatedPerson json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(People[i]) return } } } And finally, loop through the slice, look for the element with the same ID to replace with the Person object wiht updated values.\nDeleting a person (Delete Operation)\u003e Deleting a person (Delete Operation) # Deleting the element works the same way as update operation.\nextract ID loop through the slice find the right element and remove the element func deletePerson(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { fmt.Println(\u0026#34;Endpoint Hit: deletePerson\u0026#34;) vars := strings.Split(r.URL.Path, \u0026#34;/\u0026#34;) param := vars[len(vars)-1] id, _ := strconv.Atoi(param) for key, person := range People { if person.ID == id { People = append(People[:key], People[key+1:]...) } } } However, it is more like updating the existing slice. When it found the right element to remove, it cut the slice in half and concatanates the two pieces back together.\nTesting the APIs\u003e Testing the APIs # If you don\u0026rsquo;t have a frontend, you can use a VScode extension Thunder Client to test the APIs. It is convenient as you can perform them in the same window unlike Postman application.\nBefore sending the HTTP requests, let\u0026rsquo;s add some dummy data, Person objects, in People slice. Since we are not using a database in this tutorial, we will hardcode it. Add the following code before creating the server.\nPeople = []Person{ {1, \u0026#34;Wai Yan\u0026#34;, 27}, {2, \u0026#34;John\u0026#34;, 48}, {3, \u0026#34;Jane\u0026#34;, 35}, } This will add three Person objects to People slice.\nThen we implement the HTTP handlers in the main function for different endpoints as we defined periviously. In the below code, the strings are endpoints and http.HandlerFunc is calling the respestive functions to operate CRUD.\nmux.Handle(\u0026#34;/get\u0026#34;, http.HandlerFunc(getPeople)) mux.Handle(\u0026#34;/person/\u0026#34;, http.HandlerFunc(getPerson)) mux.Handle(\u0026#34;/add\u0026#34;, http.HandlerFunc(addPerson)) mux.Handle(\u0026#34;/update/\u0026#34;, http.HandlerFunc(updatePerson)) mux.Handle(\u0026#34;/delete/\u0026#34;, http.HandlerFunc(deletePerson)) This tutorial doesn\u0026rsquo;t use a database. So, if you restart the server, the People slice will be reset.
